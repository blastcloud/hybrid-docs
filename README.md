# Guzzler Official Documentation

All commits made to this project on `master` are automatically built and deployed to https://guzzler.dev.

This project is built using [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). The text for each page is located in the docs directory, and all configuration is in the docs/.vuepress directory.

If you'd like to build it locally, do the following:

1. Clone the repo
1. Install the dependencies via either Yarn or NPM. (Example: `yarn install`).
1. Run the dev for hot-swapping. `yarn docs:dev`.

You can also fully build the results with `yarn docs:build`.
